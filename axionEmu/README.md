axionEmu is a ML-based CMB emulator that was trained using existing models presented in the cosmological emulator CosmoPower (https://github.com/alessiospuriomancini/cosmopower). The training data is from axionCAMB (https://github.com/dgrin1/axionCAMB). The data collection files are included in data_collection_axion folder. The trained temperature power spectrum emualtor, polarisation power spectrum emulator, and temperature-polarisation cross power spectrum emulator are in axion_CMB_models folder. The basic usage and training files are in axion_training folder, and you can read CosmoPower documentation for more explanations. For test purpose, we wrote codes for Planck 2018 analysis, see axionCAMB_EMCEE folder.
