# training_scripts

The scripts contained in this folder are ``.py`` versions of the corresponding notebooks in the [notebooks](https://github.com/alessiospuriomancini/cosmopower/blob/main/notebooks) folder. They show how to:

- train ``cosmopower_NN`` for CMB power spectra ([cosmopower_NN_CMB_training.py](https://github.com/alessiospuriomancini/cosmopower/blob/main/cosmopower/training/training_scripts/cosmopower_NN_CMB_training.py)). The procedure for the matter power spectrum is completely analogous;

- train ``cosmopower_PCAplusNN`` for CMB power spectra ([cosmopower_PCAplusNN_CMB_training.py](https://github.com/alessiospuriomancini/cosmopower_public/blob/main/training/training_scripts/cosmopower_PCAplusNN_CMB_training.py)).
